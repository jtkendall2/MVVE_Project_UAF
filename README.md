# Microgrid Variable Voltage Emulator

## Overview
The MVVE (Microgrid Variable Voltage Emulator) project aims to create a system for emulating microgrid voltage profiles using a variac (variable transformer) controlled by software. This Python-based tool is designed to assist with the testing and validation of microgrid-connected equipment under variable voltage conditions.

## Current Status
    - [x] Functional User Interface
    - [x] Control software for simulated data
    - [ ] Integration with physical hardware

## Installation

1. Clone repository
2. Install required Python 
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
1. Run the application with:
``` bash
python -m mvve.main
```
2. Load a csv voltage profile

3. Use "Start", "Pause", and "Stop" buttons as needed
